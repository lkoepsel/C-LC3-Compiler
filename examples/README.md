# Examples README

This folder of examples, serves two purposes:
1. To test the C compiler for different *C Language constructs*
2. To demonstrate how to perform specific instructions 

## List of examples

## add
Simple program to add two numbers, the most simple program to demonstrate how the compiler works

## functions
Original intent was to test the ability to have multiple functions in a file. Now fixed, it demonstrates how to use functions.

## imm
Original compiler used immediate addressing to add numbers. This limited the ability to add numbers greater than +/- 16. This has been updated and the program demonstrates both methods work.

## inc
Increment and decrment, postfix and prefix, didn't work. Now working, the program demonstrates how they work

## pointers
An example to demonstrate simple pointers.
